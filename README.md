## Quickstart
it's reccomended to bind 'Debug: select and start debugging' in VSCode keybinds to F5, from there
you just press F5 then enter to test this program

## Adds all __init__ files
recursively checks subfolders of your python directory

adds __init__.py files as needed

## Removes all __init__ files
recursively checks subfolders of your python directory

removes __init__.py files as needed

## Auto-save
saves memory and increases speed by saving the python directory and its sub-directories

so that the next time the script runs, it doesn't have to check the expected location of the __init__ files again

must delete json paths file located in powershell/json_pre_loading when your directory structure changes
